# SAV-Agent

The SAV-Agent folder contains the source code for the SAV-Agent module in the SAVOP project. Essentially, the SAV-Agent module is responsible for interacting with SAV-apps. SAV-apps are responsible for generating SAV rules based on the information/events provided by Agent. The SAV agent has a in-event buffer and a out-event buffer to de-coupling the transmission and processing of event. Each received event is notified to SAV-apps. On the other hand, SAV-apps can send events to the SAV agent if they need to send a message to other agent. The SAV agent provides a set of interfaces for SAV-apps that allows them to fetch required information such as FIB, adjust-in RIB or a message from other agent. However, SAV-apps are triigered by the SAV agent to generate SAV rules. The SAV agent is also responsible for sending the generated SAV rules to the SAV-Agent and Agent will decide which rule should be installed.
